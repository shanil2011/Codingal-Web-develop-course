                <p>Shipwrecks have fascinated people for centuries, combining mystery, history, and adventure. They can range from ancient vessels lost at sea to modern ships meeting untimely ends.Here are some shipwrecks below:</p>
                <h2 style="color: aqua;">SS Edmund Fitzgerald</h2>
                <p>The majestic SS Edmund Fitzgerald was an American freighter ship. The ship was launched on 7th June 1958 and was the biggest vessel to ply on the Great Lakes of North America at that time. 

                    It carried a cargo of Taconite iron ore from mines near Minnesota to the ironworks in Ohio, Michigan and Detroit. It was a famous ship that broke its previous records and set new ones in its 17 years of service.
                    The ship embarked on her last unfortunate voyage from Wisconsin, near Duluth, on 9th November 1975. It was carrying a cargo of ore pellets and was headed by Captain Ernest M. Mc Sorley. 

The ship was destined for a steel factory in Detroit and was moving when it was joined by another ship SS. Arthur M. Anderson. The next day, both ships were caught in a strong storm with hurricane winds and almost 11 m high waves. 
On the evening of 10th November 1975, Edmund Fitzgerald sank around 17 miles north-northwest of Whitefish Point, Michigan. The entire 29-member crew went down with it in what has become the greatest Great Lakes Shipping Tragedy of all time. 

It was found by an aircraft belonging to the US Navy on 14th November 1975. Three expeditions were conducted at the site, and at the request of the family members of the crew, the ship’s bronze bell was retrieved on 4th July 1995.

                <h2 style="color: aqua;">HMHS Britannic</h2>
                <p>Belonging to the Olympic class of steamships, the White Star Line vessel was the youngest sistership of the RMS Olympic and the RMS Titanic. It was constructed to be a passenger liner; however, she functioned as a hospital ship from 1915 until she finally sank in November 1916.

                    It entered service before the First World War started. The ship was carefully designed, and lessons learned from the sinking of the Titanic were implemented in its construction to make it safe and comfortable.
                    In 1915-16, It sailed between Britain and the Dardanelles. On 21st November 1916, she was shaken by a blast which occurred due to a naval mine of the German Navy. The incident took place near the Greek island of Kea in the Aegean Sea. 
The ship sank around an hour later and killed 30 people. The ship became the biggest ship that sank during World War I and, more so, tragically. Of the 1066 people, 1036 survived and were rescued from the water and the lifeboats. 
In 1975, its wreck was located, and it became the world’s biggest and most well-preserved passenger liner.

                <h2 style="color: aqua;">HMS Curacoa</h2>
                <p>HMS Curacoa was a light cruiser constructed for the Royal Navy. HMS Curacoafunctioned as a flagship most of the time. Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet in 1919, she was sent to the Baltic to support the British forces in their campaign during the Civil War in Russia. 
                    After encountering a naval mine, the ship suffered damage and was sent to be repaired. Later it was shifted to the Mediterranean fleet in 1922-23 to support British Troops in Turkey. 
                    The ship was converted to a training ship in 1933, and in 1939, before the Second World War started, it was made into an anti-aircraft cruiser.After 1940, this ship became an escort ship. In 1942, it escorted the RMS Queen Mary, which resulted in the tragedy. The former was carrying around 15,000 US troops and was moving in a zigzag course to avoid German bombers and possible enemy vessels. 
                    Queen May caught up with the escort ship Curacoa and was trying to overtake her. One of the seamen of Curacoa, Ernest Watson, was admiring Queen Mary when he noticed its bow swinging toward the cruiser. He realised that the two ships were soon going to collide.
                    The 20 times bigger Queen Mary rammed into Curacoa’s metal plating and sliced it in half before it sank in no time. Out of 430 men onboard, only 99 seamen and 2 officers survived.

                <h2 style="color: aqua;">The fleet of Kublai Khan</h2>
                <p>Kublai Khan’s lost fleet is one of the most famous shipwrecks of old times. Two Mongolian invasion fleet attempting to attack Japan was wrecked in storms in 1274 and 1281, killing tens of thousands of troops.
                    Several artefacts belonging to these vessels were found centuries later on the seabed of the Imari Gulf. In October 2001, an entire shipwreck claimed to originate from Fujian in south China was discovered by archaeologists.
                    Recently in 2015, archaeologists located a Mongolian ship in a bay close to the city of Matsuura, near the island of Kyushu.

                <h2 style="color: aqua;">The Spanish Armada</h2>
                <p>The Spanish Armada, a fleet of 130 ships on a mission to invade England in 1588, was disrupted by storms, and a large number of the Armada’s ships were wrecked on the coasts of Scotland and Ireland, killing around 5000 soldiers.
                    Among the drowned were most of the soldiers and crewmembers of the 32-gun warship La Juliana, built near Barcelona in 1570.
                    In 1985, local divers discovered the wreckage of three fleet vessels, including La Lavia, La Santa Maria de Vision, and La Juliana. In 2015, several cannons from La Juliana were found in the sands off Streedagh in Co Sligo.

                <h2 style="color: aqua;">RMS Titanic</h2>
                <p>RMS Titanic, the most famous ship for never making her destination, was the largest cruise ship of its time. The Titanic was built in Ireland at the Harland and Wolff shipyard. It was considered to be the most developed ship of that era.
                    However, the Titanic, famously described as ‘unsinkable,’ unfortunately sank after colliding against an iceberg on its maiden voyage- from Southampton to New York City- on 14 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean.
                    Around 1,517 people lost their lives in one of the biggest marine tragedies in history.
After many unsuccessful expeditions, the wreck was finally located by a joint French–American expedition in 1985. Several artefacts and debris have been removed from the shipwreck and are displayed in the National Maritime Museum in England.
Many schemes were proposed to raise the ship, but the fragile condition of the vessel prevented such plans. The 2001 UNESCO Convention now protects the wreck of the RMS Titanic.

                <h2 style="color: aqua;">RMS Empress of Ireland</h2>
                <p>Canadian ocean liner RMS Empress of Ireland sank near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River on 29 May 1914 after colliding with the Norwegian collier SS Storstad due to thick fog, killing 1012 people.
                    The vessel was en route from Quebec City to Liverpool, with 1057 passengers and a crew of 420 abroad, when the ship went down in one of the worst disasters in Canadian maritime history.
                    At present, the wreck of Empress of Ireland lies in a shallow 130 ft of water.
                    Several divers have recovered several valuables, including silver bars, a brass bell, and a stern telemeter, from the ship on several occasions after the incident.

                <h2 style="color: aqua;">MS Estonia</h2>
                <p>The Estonia ship casualty in the Baltic Sea is one of the biggest maritime incidents in the recent past. The cruise ferry MS Estonia, built in the German shipyard Meyer Werft, was en route to Stockholm from the Estonian province of Tallinn when it sank on 28 September 1994.
                    Over 800 people lost their lives in this horrifying incident, and most of the bodies were never recovered.
                    The cause of the accident remains controversial as there are many theories about the cause of the sinking. The most commonly known reason for the accident is said to be the rough weather conditions that the ship encountered.

                <h2 style="color: aqua;">The Andrea Doria</h2>
                <p>The Italian ocean liner Andrea Doria sank after colliding against the Swedish ship MS Stockholm in July 1956, killing 46 people.
                    The vessel, which had 1,134 passengers and 572 crew members on board, was en route to New York City when it met with one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history.
                    However, despite the severity of the incident, not many lives were lost thanks to the timely communication by the ship’s authorities and commendable rescue efforts.
                    After the sinking of the vessel, divers Peter Gimbel and Joseph Fox managed to locate the wreck of Andrea Doria.
Today, resting in some 240 feet of the North Atlantic water, the wreck of Andrea Doria has become a popular site among scuba divers, being called “Mount Everest of scuba diving.”

                <h2 style="color: aqua;">HMS Victory</h2>
                <p>The 100-gun ship of the Royal Navy, HMS Victory, was launched in 1737 and met with an accident in the English Channel in 1744.

                    The sinking of HMS Victory, one of the worst British naval disasters in the English Channel, claimed the lives of more than 1,000 sailors.
                    
                    The ship disappeared in the Channel Islands, and for over 250 years, there was no sight of any remains of the ship.

                <h2 style="color: aqua;">The Carpathia</h2>
                <p>The British passenger liner RMS Carpathia is best known for rescuing survivors from the Titanic when the cruise ship met with an accident.

                    However, Carpathia met with the same destiny when it was destroyed by a German submarine in the year 1917, at the time of World War I.
