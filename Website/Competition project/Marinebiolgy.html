                <h2 style="color: aqua;">1. Marine Ecosystems</h2><br><p>Marine ecosystems are diverse environments that exist in the ocean and along its shores, characterized by the interaction between living organisms and their aquatic surroundings. They cover over 70% of Earth's surface and play a critical role in supporting life on the planet. Below are key aspects of marine ecosystems:</p>
                <h3 style="color: aqua;">Types of Marine Ecosystems:</h3><p><h4>1.Open Ocean (Pelagic Zone)</h4>

                    Largest marine ecosystem, ranging from the surface to the deep ocean.
                    Includes organisms like plankton, fish, whales, and sharks.
                    <h4>2.Coral reefs</h4>
                    
                    Found in shallow, warm waters; known as the "rainforests of the sea" for their biodiversity.
                    Home to coral polyps, fish, crustaceans, and sea turtles.
                    <h4>3.Estuaries</h4>
                    
                    Transitional areas where freshwater rivers meet the sea.
                    High in nutrients, supporting species like fish, birds, and shellfish.
                    <h4>4.Mangroves</h4>
                    
                    Coastal forests that protect shorelines and support marine life like crabs, shrimp, and fish.
                    <h4>5.Deep-Sea Ecosystems</h4>
                    
                    Found at extreme depths with little light; organisms here adapt to high pressure and low temperatures.
                    <h4>6.Kelp Forests</h4>
                    
                    Dominated by large brown algae (kelp) and provide shelter to species like sea otters and fish.
                    <h4>7.Polar Oceans</h4>
                    
                    Cold-water ecosystems near the Arctic and Antarctic, supporting species like penguins, seals, and polar bears.</p>
