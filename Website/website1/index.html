      <p>Milestone College (Bengali: মাইলস্টোন কলেজ) is a Bengali and English-medium, co-educational private school in Uttara Model Town, Dhaka, Bangladesh.
      
      [2] It was founded by Colonel Nuran Nabi (কর্নেল নুরুন নবি) (Retd) who was also the founding principal of RAJUK Uttara Model College.[3]
      
      Milestone ranked tenth nationally in Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examination results in 2014.[4]

      It has 8 campus and all the campus are situatiing in Dhaka.<br><br>We, being backed up by a number of specialist teaching staffs and excellent facilities and resources, offer a wide range of courses in the college. Milestone College is a non-profitable organization established by the MNRS TRUST. Now it is run by a Board of Governors approved by the Board of Intermediate & Secondary Education, Dhaka under the Ministry of Education, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. The institution, growing from a Kindergarten to a Junior School and then to a Secondary School, has now emerged as a leading College of Bangladesh. Since inception, the institute has been enjoying a proud record of academic excellence and innovation. Over the years, it has generated a significant number of employments of qualified academicians, administrators and staffs.<br><br>

      We, a number of educationists, had been discussing for a long time about the establishment of an educational institution of international standard. Among us, some have worked and are still working in universities and the others have worked at renowned colleges and cadet colleges as professors & principals. In the light of our long experience, we have perceived that our children, despite securing good results and being meritorious, cannot attain the expected results because of excessive coyness. They are introvert; they know but cannot express their thoughts. Moreover, having completed their education in Bangla Medium, most of these students remain weak in writing and speaking in English. As a result, when they go abroad for higher studies, they fall in deep water. Even in our own country, they fail to get a good job in the multinational companies.<br><br>

      As part of its commitment to serve the education needs of the community and the nation, Milestone College envisages to run international curriculums as well. Being able to implement English medium curriculums side by side with the national curriculums in Bengali and English Versions will enable our learners to achieve higher level of academic excellence and professionalism, the two pre-requisites for any anyone to be integrated as global citizens in today’s world.<br><br>
